# Haskellenges

Haskellenges starts from an idea to collect the files of the Haskell
challenges I've solved on HackerRank and LeetCode. This is a way to
keep track of my progress and to have a reference to look at when I
need to solve similar problems. Plus, it's a way to share my solutions
with the community. This was made for the purpose of learning and
improving my functional programming skills.
